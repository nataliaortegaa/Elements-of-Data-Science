Elements of Data Science course using R studio. Focused on Data Analytics including Machine Learning. Introduction to Data Visualization and Networks. 

This repository includes two projects for the class, hence they encapsulate what learned in class. 

For the first project for the class we worked on the analyzing the performance data for the Rubik's World Championship since its beginnings to today.
We used the data to understand trends amongst successful competitors and to predict the future statistics for the sport. 

For the second project and final project for the class, the goal was to build a prediction model that can predict ambient air pollution concentrations across the continental United States. We compared 4 models: Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees and Random Forest and then using RMSE we found the best performance model.
